# Lambda Function For Weather Estimation

## This repo contains lambda function which is used to create a chatbot which tells the current weather of various US based cities. 

### I have used pyowm library to connect with OpenWeatherMap by using its API. This lambda function is made locally by creating a new virtual environment. Pyowm is also installed locally inside the same virtual environment. Then all the files inside site-packages folder of virtual environment including lambda function and pyowm is zipped and finally uploaded to lambda console for creating a custom chatbot with the help of Amazon Lex


- Change the API key if it becomes invalid in future and use your own API key by signing in <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">here</a>.
